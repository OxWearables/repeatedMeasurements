In this showcase we use one of the most basic correction methods, suitable for analyses using a single error-prone exposure alongside non-error prone covariates. Specifically: 

- The adjusted $\beta$ coefficient is given by $\frac{\beta}{\lambda}$.
- The variance on the adjusted coefficient can be calculated using the delta method, giving (Ref: Knuiman et al 1998, DOI:10.1016/s1047-2797(97)00107-5): 
$$
Var(\beta_{z}) = \frac{Var(\beta_x)}{\lambda^2} + \bigg(\frac{\beta_x}{\lambda^2}\bigg)^2Var(\lambda)
$$
